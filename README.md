# Today's News

News project, using two APIs simultaneously (https://newsapi.org/) and (https://newsdata.io/)

TweetWorld

An application used to show today's news, using two APIs simultaneously (https://newsapi.org/) and (https://newsdata.io/), built with vite+ React and Sass preprocessor.


## Deployment

Due to recent changes in the free developer keys of one of the APIs, it is not possible to make the data visible in production, so it is not possible to deploy the app in production/ github pages.
